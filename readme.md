> Collecting places around the internet.

These are some cool things I found over the past years, and I wanted to have a way to find them again. The idea and format comes from [synkretie.net](https://www.synkretie.net/links/), but rather than regularly put up a collection of links, for now the Idea is to have just one page. Over time I will add links, and might also delete links if I find that something doesn't meet the standard anymore.
